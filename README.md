## Project Requirements

You've been through quite a few Project Modes by now and should have some idea how to think about scoping a project, what you can accomplish in the designated time, and what is expected of you in terms of meeting complexity requirements.

The guidelines here are minimal but be sure that you:

* Use a Rails API backend with a separate React frontend that are created in two different Github repositories.
* Have at least three resources (three DB tables) on the backend and your application must have full CRUD actions for at least one resource.
* Must have at least two different client-side routes (i.e. use react-router). Ex: even if your whole app is mostly a single page app, have the form to signup be found at /signup
* Optional: Your application can have authentication/authorization. You are welcome to use an auth template as discussed in class.
